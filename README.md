# Microprocessor-Lab
MP Lab experiments carried out as part of the college coursework. The repository includes a mix of hardware-based IoT experiments and Assembly Language Programming exercises. Most experiments were done using ARIES Vega 3.0 microcontroller, but the codes can also be practiced or simulated using platforms on other boards.
