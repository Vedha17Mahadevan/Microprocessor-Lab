# Microprocessor-Lab

Microprocessor Lab experiments carried out as part of the college coursework. The repository includes a mix of **hardware-based IoT experiments** and **Assembly Language Programming (ALP)** exercises.

Most of the experiments were implemented using **ARIES Vega 3.0** microcontrollers.  
However, the same codes and concepts can also be practiced or simulated on other boards like **ESP32**, or **Arduino**.
